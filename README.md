# password-encryption

This project provides a script, desktop app and android app developed for the generation of strong passwords based on some user input. The main idea of the usage is the following: you have your own scheme of password creation for example: myName+hostName+birthdayDate. Unfortunately, this is not a strong password. This app uses some numerical key (ex. birthday date of your mother, your universoty index number etc.) to transform your favorite but easy password into a stronger one. The transformation is based on polynomial action and is fully deterministic.

Any time you need to use the password you can generate it but the **only think you need to remember is your numerical key (4-6 digits) and password creation scheme**
